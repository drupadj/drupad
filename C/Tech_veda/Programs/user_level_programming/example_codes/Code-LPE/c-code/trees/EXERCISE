create a library with functions that can be used to represent a
graph. Assume a graph to be an inter connection of GraphNodes.

deine a structure to represent GraphNode

Functions to be implemented.

1) GraphNode *createGNode();
2) void createLink(GraphNode *n1,GrapthNode *n2);
3) void DestroyGraph(GraphNode *gn);

Write a test program to test the library function.

Hints:
Use the following structures for implementing the above library.
(Note : code will be very much similar to the implementation of tree)

struct GLink {
	void *node1;
	void *node2;
}
typedef struct GN{
	int nodedata;
	struct GLink **listoflinks;
}GraphNode;
