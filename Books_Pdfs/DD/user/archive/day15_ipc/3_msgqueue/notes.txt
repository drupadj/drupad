$ man 7 mq_overview

POSIX message queues allow processes to exchange data in the form of messages

General usage for message queues is as follows:

	1. Get a message queue descriptor with a call to the mq_open function.

	2. Send and receive messages with calls to the mq_send and mq_receive functions.

	3. Close the message queue with a call to the mq_close function.

	4. Remove the message queue with a call to the mq_unlink function.
